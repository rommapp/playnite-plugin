# Overview

This plugin allows you to import your RomM library into Playnite. It queries the RomM API to create Playnite library entires for each of your games. Installing a game in Playnite will download it from RomM and store it on your system, allowing you to launch it in your emulator of choice.

> [!WARNING]
> The plugin requires a RomM instance setup with IGDB API credentials, otherwise it won't work. You can find more information on how to set generate and set credentials in the [docs](https://docs.romm.app/latest/Getting-Started/Generate-API-Keys/).

## Installation
